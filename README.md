This is the main source code repository for **Rive**. It contains the compiler and standard library.

[Website]: https://rive-lang.github.io/
[Getting Started]: #quick-start
[Documentation]: https://rive-lang.github.io/docs/
[Contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md

## Why Rive?

- **Safety:** Built-in memory and thread safety without a garbage collector—eliminate entire classes of bugs at compile time.

- **Performance:** Zero-cost abstractions and direct control over hardware let you write code that runs as fast as C or Rust.

- **Progressive Complexity:** Start simple, scale smoothly. Rive grows with you—from scripts to systems—without paradigm shifts.

## Quick Start

> 💡 **Note**: Rive is under active development. The compiler is not yet stable.

To build Rive from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rive-lang/rive.git
cd rive
# Add your build instructions (e.g., `cargo build`, etc.)
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a development environment.
